s(ASP) Internal Documentation {#mainpage}
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This documentation provides an overview of the internals of the s(ASP)
system. This document is intended for those wishing to understand or edit
s(ASP)'s code. Users of s(ASP) should consult the README file located in
the root directory of the distribution. We apologize for the confusion,
but as of this writing, PlDoc requires that this file use the same name.

Generating Documentation
------------------------

The s(ASP) system's internal documentation is designed for use with
[PlDoc](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/pldoc.html). The included
doc_gen.pl can be used to generate documentation for the s(ASP) system and open
it in a web browser.

Modifying the Code
------------------

When editing to or adding s(ASP)'s code, use PlDoc-compatible comments to
ensure that the automatic documentation generation remains functional. For help
with properly documenting the code, refer to the
[PlDoc Manual](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/pldoc.html). For
additional help with Markdown syntax as used in this file, refer to the
[doxygen User Manual](http://www.doxygen.org/manual.html). Note that not all
doxygen features are supported by PlDoc.
