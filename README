1. Description
--------------

The c(ASP) system is the CIAO version of s(ASP). The s(ASP) system is
an implementation of the stable model semantics which does not require
any form of grounding. Unlike similar systems, it can work with
programs which have no finite grounding, as well as accept lists and
terms as predicate arguments.


2. License
----------

The c(ASP) system is distributeed under similar condition of the
s(ASP) system without reference to the UTD.

The s(ASP) system is distributed under the 3-clause BSD license
(a.k.a. BSD-3, Modified BSD License or New BSD License). See the file

4. Installation
---------------

See src/README for the installation instructions of c(ASP) and its HTML
local_interface.

5. Usage
--------

The c(ASP) system accepts modified normal logic programs (see Input Program
Format below) and executes them under the stable model semantics. Two modes of
execution are supported: automatic and interactive.

Automatic mode will execute programs using either a hard-coded query or an empty
query if no hard-coded query is available. The number of stable models computed
will be determined by either the default value in 'src/config.pl' or a value
given as a command line argument.

Interactive mode works similarly to traditional Prolog systems: the user is
provided with a prompt to enter queries. Answers can then be accepted by
pressing '.' or rejected by pressing ';'. Pressing 'h' at the prompt will
explain both options.

The general format for invoking c(ASP) is:
    sasp [options] <inputfile(s)>
The available options are:
    -h, -?, --help     Print this help message and terminate.
    -i, --interactive  Run in user / interactive mode.
    -a, --auto         Run in automatic mode (no user interaction).
    -sN                Compute N answer sets, where N >= 0. 0 for all.
                       Ignored unless running in automatic mode.
    -v, --verbose      Enable verbose progress messages.
    -vv, --veryverbose Enable very verbose progress messages.
    -j                 Print proof tree for each solution.
    -w                 Generate html file with proof tree for each solution.
    -n                 Hide goals added to solution by global consistency checks.
    -la                Print a separate list of succeeding abducibles with each
                       CHS. List will only be printed if at least one abducible
                       has succeeded.
For example,
    casp -i test1.lp
will execute the program 'test1.lp' in interactive mode.


6. Input Program Format
-----------------------

The format for c(ASP) programs is that of normal logic programs (NLPs) with a
number of optional modifications. These modifications are hard-coded queries,
the ability to suppress specific predicates from output, a number of special
directive statements, negatively constrained variables and support for
arithmetic operations.


+++ 6.1 Hard-Coded Queries

Queries may be hard-coded into a program using one of the following two formats:
    ?- goal_1, ..., goal_n.
    #compute N { goal_1, ..., goal_n }.
Both formats will execute the query 'goal_1, ..., goal_n' when the program is
executed in automatic mode. In the second format, N is an integer specifying
the number of solutions to compute. A value of 0 indicates that all solutions
should be found. Queries using the first format will use the default solution
count specified in config.pl. For example, consider the following two queries:
    ?- member(X, [1, 2]).
    #compute 3 { member(X, [1,2]) }.
The first will compute the default number of solutions, whatever that may be.
The second will attempt to compute 3 solutions. As there are only two (assuming
a standard definition of member/2), it will find the first two and then fail.

Several things are worth noting: First, the '-s' command line will override any
hard-coded solution count. Next, hard-coded queries are ignored when running in
interactive mode. Finally, if multiple queries are specified in a single
program, all but the last will be silently discarded.


+++ 6.2 Hiding Predicates in Output

As the models returned by c(ASP) can be quite large, it is often desirable to
omit unwanted predicates from the output. This can be done by appending an
underscore ('_') character to the beginning of the predicate name. Such
predicates will be executed normally, but neither they nor their negations will
be included in any solutions. For example, consider the following program:
    p.
    q :- p.
    ?- q.
When executed, the solution { p, q } will be printed. However, for the program
    p.
    _q :- p.
    ?- _q.
only { p } will be printed.


+++ 6.3 Directive Statements

In addition to the #compute statement discussed above, two other special
statements are supported by c(ASP): #include and #abducible.

The #include statement is used to include additional source files, allowing a
program to be broken up across multiple files. Two formats are allowed:
    #include 'somefile.lp'.
and
    #include('somefile.lp').
If the file is in another directory, the relative or absolute path must also
be specified:
    #include 'somedir/somefile.lp'.
    #include './somedir/somefile.lp'.
    #include '../somedir/somefile.lp'.
    #include 'C:\somedir\somefile.lp'. % Windows-specific

The #abducible statement is included to simplify the use of c(ASP) for
abduction. Abducibles may be specified as follows:
    #abducible some_goal(X, Y).
This simply means that the specified goal may or may not be true. If encountered
during execution, it may be "abduced" even if the program contains no rules for
the goal.


+++ 6.4 Negatively Constrained Variables

In most logic programming systems, variables may be either bound or unbound. In
c(ASP), VARIABLES MAY BE EITHER BOUND OR NEGATIVELY CONSTRAINED. A negatively
constrained variable is associated with a PROHIBITED VALUE SET, a list of ground
values which the variable cannot be bound to. Unbound variables are treated as a
special case of negatively constrained variables in which the prohibited value
set is empty.

Values are added to the prohibited value set via DISUNIFICATION. Consider the
following examples
    X \= 5, X \= a.
Under most logic programming semantics, both of the above statements would fail,
since an unbound variable can be bound to any value. However, in c(ASP), both
statements will succeed, adding '5' and 'a' to X's prohibited value list. Any
later attempt to bind X to one of these values will fail.

Note that, as explained in Section 7, two negatively constrained variables
cannot be constrained against each other. Any attempt to do so will trigger an
error.


+++ 6.5 Loop Variables

Loop variables arise from a special case known as an EVEN LOOP, in which a
recursive call is encountered with an even, non-zero number of negations between
the recursive call and its ancestor. An even loop indicates that every call in
the loop may be either true or false, unless some element of the cycle succeeds
or is forced to fail via other rules in the program.

If an even loop succeeds with the same negatively constrained variable in both 
the recursive call and its ancestor, this variable is known as a LOOP VARIABLE. 
In such cases, if the program has at least one stable model, it will have an 
infinite number of partial stable models. This is because predicates containing 
the loop variable may be true or false for every value in the loop variable's 
domain.

The c(ASP) system compactly represents these cases by prefixing loop variables
with a '?' in c(ASP)'s output. For example, consider the following program with
the query '?- p(X).': 
    p(X) :- not q(X).
    q(X) :- not p(X).
An infinite number of partial stable models exist for this program, such as:
    { p(1), q(2), not p(2), not q(1) }
    { p(1), q(a), q(b), not p(a), not p(b), not q(1) }
and so on. However, c(ASP) will produce only the following result:
    { p(?X), not q(?X) }
This concisely represents that, for each value of ?X, p/1 and q/1 may be either
true or false, so long as they are not both true or both false for the same
value.


+++ 6.6 Arithmetic and Comparisons

The c(ASP) system provides a number of built-in, inline operators, described
below.

The two most important operators are unification ('=') and disunification
('\='). For ground values, both operators function identically to their Prolog
equivalents. For one ground value and one negatively constrained variable,
unification will function as in Prolog, while disunification will add the ground
value to the variable's prohibited value list. For two negatively constrained
variables, unification will unify the variables and merge their prohibited value
lists, while disunification will produce an error (see Section 7).

The remaining arithmetic and comparison operators are detailed below:

Operator	Usage
is		Arithmetic assignment; identical to Prolog operator
=:=		Equality (numbers)
=\=		Inequality (numbers)
<		Less than (numbers)
=<		Less than or equal to (numbers)
>		Greater than (numbers)
>=		Greater than or equal to (numbers)
@<		Less than (terms)
@=<		Less than or equal to (terms)
@>		Greater than (terms)
@>=		Greater than or equal to (terms)
+		Addition
-		Subtraction
*		Multiplication
/		Division
rem		Remainder (integers only)
mod		Modulus (integers only)
<<		Bitwise shift left (integers only): X is 8 << 1 yields X = 16.
>>		Bitwise shift right (integers only): X is 8 >> 1 yields X = 4.
**		Exponent: X is 8**2 yields X = 64.
^		Exponent (identical to **)

7. Restrictions on Input Programs
---------------------------------

In addition to the accepted program format, c(ASP) places three limitations on
what constitutes a 'legal' program. First, as in Prolog, arithmetic statements
must be ground at the time they are evaluated. For example, the statement
    X is Y + 2
will succeed if Y is bound to a number, but will throw an error otherwise.
Negatively constrained variables can never be constrained against each other.
For example, given the query
    ?- X \= 2, Y \= 3, X \= Y.
the final goal will throw an error. However, the query
    ?- X \= 2, Y is 3, X \= Y.
will succeed because Y is no longer negatively constrained when it is disunified
with X. Finally, programs cannot allow success through left recursion. This
final restriction is a limitation of the current implementation, and we hope to
remove it in a future release.
