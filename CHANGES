s(ASP) 1.0.7: June 28, 2017
- Fixed bug with loop variables that were already constrained being constrained
  against other variables.
- Fixed bug where using classically negated literals without their non-negated
  counterparts would produce incorrect results.
s(ASP) 1.0.6: May 10, 2017
- Fixed a bug with loop variables being constrained against other variables.
s(ASP) 1.0.5: January 28, 2017
- Added a switch (-j) to print the proof tree (justification) for each solution.
- Added a switch (-n) to hide goals added to a solution by global consistency
  checks (NMR check).
- Added a switch (-la) to print a list of succeeding abducibles with each CHS.
- Switched licenses from GPLv2 to to 3-clause BSD ("Modified BSD License").
s(ASP) 1.0.4: May 16, 2016
- Fixed a bug when printing unbound variables that were unified with each other.
- Fixed bug with forall handling. Preexisting constraints on a variable are now
  correctly preserved when a forall over that variable succeeds (currently it
  will never be called with a constrained variable, but a bug is a bug).
s(ASP) 1.0.3: January 16, 2016
- Fixed bug in which CHS entries not marked as successful could cause a call to
  coinductively fail.
s(ASP) 1.0.2: January 12, 2016
- Added built-in predicates for write/1, writef/2 and nl/0.
- Fixed major bug related to coinductive failure checking.
- Fixed several bugs related to quoted strings.
s(ASP) 1.0.1: November 29, 2015
- Fixed bug where multiple underscore variables in a clause were treated as the
  same variable.
- Cleaned up debugging output.
s(ASP) 1.0.0: September 15, 2015
- Initial release.
